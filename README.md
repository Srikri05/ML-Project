# Credit Card Limit Guesser

## Introduction
The "Credit Card Limit Guesser" project aims to predict a customer's credit card limit based on their demographic and financial characteristics. This predictive model can assist financial institutions in assessing credit risk and allocating credit efficiently.

## Problem Formulation
We frame this as a supervised learning regression problem. The goal is to model the credit card limit as a function of customer features such as income, age, marital status, and education. The target variable, `credit_limit`, is continuous, making regression the appropriate choice.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers and their credit card limits. Key details include:
- **Number of samples**: 10,000
- **Number of features**: Age, income, education, marital status, etc.
- **Label**: `credit_limit` (a continuous value)

### Preprocessing Steps
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize or scale numerical features.
- Encode categorical variables.

## Chosen ML Method
For Stage 1, we select **Linear Regression** as the initial machine learning model. This choice is justified because:
- The target variable (credit card limit) is continuous.
- Linear Regression is interpretable and provides a baseline for prediction accuracy.
- It allows us to understand the relationship between features and the target variable.

## Preliminary Analysis
- The distribution of `credit_limit` is right-skewed.
- Income shows a strong positive correlation with `credit_limit` (correlation coefficient â‰ˆ 0.7).
- Age has a weak correlation with `credit_limit`.
- Outliers are present in features like income, which may require handling in preprocessing.

### Visualizations
- Histogram of `credit_limit`.
- Scatterplot of `income` vs. `credit_limit`.
- Boxplot of `credit_limit` grouped by categorical features (e.g., marital status).

## Plan for Stage 2
In the next stage, we will:
1. Experiment with additional ML methods such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines.
2. Compare the performance of these models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
3. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
4. Evaluate the models on a test set to ensure generalization.
